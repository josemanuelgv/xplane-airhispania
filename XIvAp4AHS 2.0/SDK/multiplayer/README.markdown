#libxplanemp
###Multiplayer library for X-Plane

This is libxplanemp, the multiplayer code for X-Plane.  This code is
used in both the XSquawkBox and X-IvAp projects.

See README.MULTIPLAYER for more information.

To clone this repository to your local drive, use:
git clone https://github.com/wadesworld2112/libxplanemp

###Compilation Note

The files CSLLoaderThread.h and CSLLoaderThread.cpp are incomplete and will generate
errors.  They are not currently used.  The library will compile if these 
files are not included.  

Fixes to these files are welcome.

## Note to X-Plane and X-IvAp Developers

This is now the authoratative repository for the mulitplayer code.  If you 
have previously been using Martin Domig's X-IvAp subversion repository on SourceForge,
the multiplayer code contained within that repository is now deprecated and will 
be removed.

Similarly, if you have been using the xivap repository provided by VATSIM, that
repository is now deprecated and will be deleted.

All future updates will be made to this repository.

##Migration Note

The two separate versions of the multiplayer code have been combined into this
repository.  Tags have been added for ease of access, should you
desire to obtain the code in the state it existed at the time of the 
repository merge.

To do so, after cloning the repository, run either of the following commands:

Multiplayer as it existed on X-IvAp SourceForge:
git checkout -b &lt;new branch name&gt; last_xivap_subversion

Multiplayer as it existed on XSB/VATSIM git repository:
git checkout -b &lt;<new branch name&gt; last_xivap_xsb

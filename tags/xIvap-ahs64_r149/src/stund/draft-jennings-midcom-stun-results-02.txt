Abstract

   IETF has several groups that are considering the impact of NATs on
   various protocols.  Having a classification of the types of NATs that
   are being developed and deployed is useful in gauging the impact of
   various solutions.  This draft records the results of classifying
   NATs using the STUN protocol.

   This work is being discussed on the ietf-behave@list.sipfoundry.org
   mailing list

Internet-Draft             STUN Test Results                October 2004


1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

   In this document, the term NAT means port address translation.  This
   is an unfortunate use of the terminology but is what NAT has come to
   mean.

2.  Introduction

   A major issue in working with NAT traversal solutions for various
   protocols is that NATs behave in many different ways.  RFC 3489
   (STUN) classifies these and provides a method to test them.  This
   draft describes the results of testing several residential style
   NATs.

   Several NATs attempt to use the same external port number as the
   internal host used.  This is referred to as port preservation.  On
   the NATs that did this, some were found to have different
   characteristics depending on whether the port was already in use or
   not.  This was tested by running the STUN tests from a particular
   port on one internal IP address and then running them again from the
   same port on a different internal IP address.  The results from the
   first interface, where the port was preserved are referred to as the
   primary type while the results from the second interface, which did
   not manage to get the same external port because it was already in
   use, is referred to as the secondary type.  On most NATs the
   secondary type is the same as the primary but on some it is
   different; these are referred to as nondeterministic NATs, since a
   client with a single internal IP address can not figure out what the
   type of the NAT is.

   There are several NATs that would be detected as address restricted
   by the STUN tests but are not.  These NATs always use the same
   external port as the internal port and store the IP address of the
   most recent internal host to send a packet on that port.  The NATs
   then forward any traffic arriving to the external interface of the
   NAT on this port to the most recent internal host to use it.  These
   NATs are labeled of type "Bad" in the result table since they do not
   meet the definitions of NAPT in RFC 3022.  Interestingly, as long as
   the clients behind the NAT choose random port numbers, they often do
   work.  STUN detects these NATs as address restricted although they
   are really not address restricted NATs.  This type of NAT is easily
   detected by sending a STUN packet from the same port on two different
   internal IP addresses and looking at the mapped port in the return.
   If both packets were mapped to the same external port, the NAT is of

   the Bad type.

   Another important aspect of a NAT for some applications is whether it
   can send media from one internal host back to another host behind the
   same NAT.  This is referred to as supporting hairpin media.

   Some NATs were rumored to exist that looked in arbitrary packets for
   either the NATs' external IP address or for the internal host IP
   address - either in binary or dotted decimal form - and rewrote it to
   something else.  STUN could be extended to test for exactly this type
   of behavior by echoing arbitrary client data and the mapped address
   but sending the bits inverted so these evil NATs did not mess with
   them.  NATs that do this will break integrity detection on payloads.

   To help organize the NATs by what types of applications they can
   support, the following groups are defined.  The application of using
   a SIP phone with a TLS connection for signaling and using STUN for
   media ports is considered.  It is assumed the RTP/RTCP media is on
   random port pairs as recommended for RTP.

      Group A: NATs that are deterministic, not symmetric, and support
      hairpin media.  These NATs would work with many phones behind
      them.
      Group B: NATs that are not symmetric on the primary mapping.  This
      group would work with many IP phones as long as the media ports
      did not conflict.  This is unlikely to happen often but will
      occasionally happen.  Because they may not support hairpin media,
      a call from one phone behind a NAT to another phone behind the
      same NAT may not work.
      Group D: NATs of the type Bad.  These have the same limitations of
      group B but when the ports conflict, media gets delivered to a
      random phone behind the NAT.
      Group F: These NATs are symmetric and phones will not work.

3.  Results

   The following table shows the results from several NATs.  This
   includes some random NATs the author had lying around as well as
   every NAT that could be purchased in February 2004 in the San Jose
   Fry's, Best Buy, CompUSA, and Circuit City.  Clearly this is not a
   very good approximation to a random sample.  It is clear that the
   NATs widely purchased in the US are different from what are available
   in Japan or in Europe.

   In the following table the Prim column indicates the primary type of
   the NAT.  A value of Port indicates port restricted, Cone is a full
   cone, Bad is described in the next section, Symm is Symmetric, and
   Addr is Address restricted.  The Hair column value of Y or N

   indicates whether the NAT will hairpin media.  The Pres column
   indicates whether the NAT attempts to preserve port numbers.  The Sec
   column indicates the secondary type of the NAT, and a value of Same
   indicates it is the same as the primary type.  The Grp indicates the
   group that this NAT falls into.

   The NAT with a secondary type of "Note 1" is particularly weird.  The
   primary connection is address restricted.  If a second host uses this
   same port, it also gets an Address Restricted but when a third host
   uses this same port, it get Symmetric.

   Another good source of information for behavior of various NATs is
   the NATCECK [6] web page.

4.  Discussion

   It is clear from discussions with various vendors and watching how
   tests have changed over the years that symmetric is becoming less
   common.  This change is being driven primarily by the desire to make
   online gaming work; many games use methods similar to STUN for NAT
   traversal.  The only symmetric NAT found was an old device.  More
   recent version of the software on the same device were not symmetric.
   It is clear that other symmetric NATs are deployed, but it is hard to
   find them.

5.  Security Concerns

   It is often assumed that symmetric NATs are more secure than port
   restricted NATs.  This is not true - they are identical from a
   security point of view.  They both only allow a packet to come inside
   the NAT if the host inside has previously sent to the exact same
   external IP and port.  One can argue that cone is less secure than
   port restricted, but this is not true if the attacker can spoof the
   IP address, which is fairly easy to do in many cases.  What level of
   security can be expected from NATs at all is a strange and curious
   topic.  With all the NATs, if you allow packets out, packets can come
   in, so don't be surprised if NATs provide less security that
   anticipated.

6.  Open Issues

   The hairpin media tests were done by having a single host use STUN to
   find a public address on the NAT and then send media to itself and

   see if it was received.  It is possible that NATs might not hairpin
   media to the same host but would hairpin media to another host behind
   the same NAT.  It is possible that because of this, the hairpin
   results reported here might be wrong.

   This sample set of NATs is very US-centric: D-Link, Lynksys, and
   Netgear dominate the US consumer market.  It would be good to get
   more results from other places.

   These test results should be verified by another group.  This has not
   been done yet.

   This draft should be moved to be consistent with the classification
   in [7].

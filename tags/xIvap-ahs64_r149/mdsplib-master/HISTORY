Version History of the MDSP Library

December 10, 2003 - Ver. 0.11
-----------------------------------
Added "dmetar" and "libmetar.a" to 'make clean'.

Added the LGPL notice to all source files and added "LICENSE".

Added up-to-date contact information to "README".


October 19, 2001 - Ver. 0.11
-----------------------------------
Added 'make install'. It copies metar.h to /usr/local/include and copies
libmetar.a to /usr/local/lib. Also chmods them to 0664.

Changed the "bool" typdef to "MDSP_BOOL" to avoid problems with C++ and
Objective C.

Added function sprint_metar. It's just prtDMTAR(), but made so that it
prints to a string. I changed prtDMTAR() so that it calls
sprint_metar().

Added function dcdNetMETAR. It decodes the METARs that the NWS provides
on their servers.

Fixed bug with printing METARs, where it would print the charVertVsby
field of decoded_METAR. This field is never set, and never used. Just
commented out the code that prints it in prtdmetr.c.


July 6, 2001 - Ver. 0.1
-----------------------------------
First release, based on the METAR Decoder Software Package version 1.8.

Made it compile and function properly with gcc.

PTypes offers a set of list templates/classes that were designed to eliminate 
the template 'code bloat' problem and also to allow reallocating of dynamic arrays 
in the most efficient way.</p>
<p><b>Why not STL containers?</b> Or, why there is no universal container for 
arbitrary types, like std::vector, in PTypes? There are 3 main reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li> A universal container template would require the item type to be either a 
POD-type or a copyable class, since it copies items during reallocation of the 
dynamic array. Otherwise, if its implementation would use fragmentation to avoid 
copying, the indexed access would become a costly operation. As a result, you 
are forced to provide copy constructors (often bulky, non-trivial code) for many 
classes in your program, even though it wouldn't be necessary otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Such container would be (and in real world it is) very inefficient for the 
same reason: each reallocation of the dynamic array requires items to be copied 
instead of just moved. Possibly a built-in reallocation operator in C++ would 
solve this problem.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The 'code bloat' problem: containers like std:vector usually produce enormous 
amount of automatically generated code (sometimes duplicate code) during instantiation 
of templates.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<b>Overview of PTypes list templates.</b> As a replacement of a universal vector-like 
container PTypes offers two separate templates: <span class="lang">tpodlist</span> 
and <span class="lang">tobjlist</span>. Each of them have certain limitations 
in return for the following advantages: reallocation of the dynamic array is being 
done in the most efficient way, templates produce no or very little code during 
instantiation.</p>
<p>The <span class="lang">tpodlist</span> template is intended for use with small 
POD (plain-old-data) objects. For bigger structures or for arbitrary non-POD types 
in general the library offers a list of pointers, <span class="lang">tobjlist</span>, 
that has the ability to automatically destroy objects when they are removed from 
the list. <span class="lang">Tobjlist</span> never reallocates items themselves, 
instead, it only deals with pointers.</p>
<p>As a universal way of holding string/object pairs in an indexed list the library 
offers the <span class="lang">tstrlist</span> template. When constructed as a 
sorted list, this template can also serve as a map indexed by textual keys. And 
finally, the <span class="lang">textmap</span> class provides a simple interface 
for mapping strings to strings, i.e. textual keys to values.</p>
<p>Historically, PTypes was using list classes that required the list item to 
be derived from <span class="lang">unknown</span>. These list classes (objlist, 
strlist and strmap) are still present in the library for backward compatibility. 
There is no such limitation in the newer versions of the library, however, deriving 
your classes from <span class="lang">unknown</span> can still give you an advantage 
of automatically detecting memory leaks in your program.</p>
<p><b>Bounds checking</b>. All list operations that involve indexes can be checked 
for validity at run-time. If an index value is invalid, the library generates 
an unrecoverable (fatal) error. Bounds checking is done when compiling your code 
in debug mode (i.e. if macro <span class="lang">DEBUG</span> is defined). You 
may also enable it explicitly for your release builds by defining <span class="lang">CHECK_BOUNDS</span>. 
Note that the bounds checking code is fully inlined and the library itself is 
not affected by these macros.</p>
<p>The list class family is declared in <a href="include/ptypes.h.html">&lt;ptypes.h&gt;</a>.</p>

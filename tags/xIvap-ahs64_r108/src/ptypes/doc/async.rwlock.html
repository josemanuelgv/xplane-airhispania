<p><span class="lang">Rwlock</span> (read/write lock) is a variation of <span class="lang">mutex</span> 
with a possibility to control critical sections more efficiently. Unlike the simple 
mutex, <span class="lang">rwlock</span> allows multiple <i>reader</i> threads 
to enter the critical section, and only one <i>writer</i> thread at a time. Reading 
and writing in this context means access to a resource or compound data shared 
between threads. Reader threads must lock the critical section with <span class="lang">rdlock()</span> 
and the writers must lock it with <span class="lang">wrlock()</span>. Both leave 
the critical section with <span class="lang">unlock()</span>.</p>
<p>This class incorporates POSIX rwlock interface on UNIX and library's own implementation 
on Windows and MacOS X. When using the <span class="lang">rwlock</span> class 
on Linux, you need to define a symbol <span class="lang">_GNU_SOURCE</span> either 
in the command line, or anywhere in your source before including any system headers.</p>
<p>Analogously to <span class="lang">scopelock</span> (see <a href="async.mutex.html">mutex</a>), 
<span class="lang">scoperead</span> and <span class="lang">scopewrite</span> are 
fully-inline'd utility classes provided for exception-safe locking of operator 
blocks.</p>
<p>Please, see <a href="portability.html">Portability and performance issues</a> 
for additional notes on rwlock implementation. </p>
<p><span class="def">rwlock::rwlock()</span> creates a <span class="lang">rwlock</span> 
object.</p>
<p><span class="def">void rwlock::rdlock()</span> locks the object for reading. 
Multiple threads can enter the critical section through <span class="lang">rdlock()</span>, 
however, if the object is already locked for writing, all reader threads wait 
until the writer leaves the critical section.</p>
<p><span class="def">void rwlock::wrlock()</span> locks the object for writing. 
If there are readers inside the critical section, the writer waits until all threads 
leave and unlock the object. Only one writer at a time can enter the critical 
section.</p>
<p><span class="def">void rwlock::unlock()</span> unlocks the object. Both readers 
and writers must use this method when leaving the critical section.</p>
<p><span class="def">scoperead::scoperead(rwlock&amp; rw)</span> creates a <span class="lang">scoperead</span> 
object and calls <span class="lang">rdlock()</span> for the object <span class="lang">rw</span>.</p>
<p><span class="def">scoperead::~scoperead()</span> calls <span class="lang">unlock()</span> 
for the <span class="lang">rwlock</span> object specified during construction 
and destroys the <span class="lang">scoperead</span> object.</p>
<p><span class="def">scopewrite::scopewrite(rwlock&amp; rw)</span> creates a <span class="def">scopewrite</span> 
object and calls <span class="lang">wrlock()</span> for the object <span class="lang">rw</span>.</p>
<p><span class="def">scopewrite::~scopewrite()</span> calls <span class="lang">unlock()</span> 
for the <span class="lang">rwlock</span> object specified during construction 
and destroys the <span class="def">scopewrite</span> object.</p>

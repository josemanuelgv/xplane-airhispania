Change Log:
	3/7/05 - Initial publication
	
XSquawkBox allows you to script it using datarefs and interplugin
messaging.  The "API" is really a series of constants used to talk
to XSquawkBox.  XSBComTester shows how you might use X-Plane SDK calls
to talk to XSquawkBox.


XSBComDefs.h - this header contains the #defines for all interplugin 
messaging and documentation on waht they do.

XSBComTester.cpp - a simple test plugin that exercises the API.

<p><span class="lang">Units</span> represent functionality similar to console 
applications in UNIX. Each unit has its own <span class="lang">main()</span> along 
with input and output 'plugs' - <span class="lang">uin</span> and <span class="lang">uout</span>, 
that may be mapped to the standard input and output, a local pipe or any other 
stream compatible with <span class="lang">instm</span> and <span class="lang">outstm</span>, 
respectively. </p>
<p>Each unit class must at least override the abstract method <span class="lang">main()</span>. 
Overridden unit classes typically read input data from <span class="lang">uin</span> 
and send the result of processing to <span class="lang">uout</span>, like if they 
were console applications. By default <span class="lang">uin</span> and <span class="lang">uout</span> 
are attached to standard input and output. After instantiating a unit object you 
(the user of a unit class) may attach any <span class="lang">instm</span>-compatible 
stream to <span class="lang">uin</span> and any <span class="lang">outstm</span>-compatible 
stream to <span class="lang">uout</span>. In addition, units are able to connect 
to each other using local pipes, and thus form data processing chains within your 
application.</p>
<p>You may define other public methods or fields in your unit class that represent 
additional options. E.g. a regular expression parser unit may have a string field 
that represents the regular expression itself (see example below).</p>
<p>Units can be run either synchronously or asynchronously. In the latter case, 
a separate thread is being created for executing unit's <span class="lang">main()</span> 
function. If connected to a pipe using <span class="lang">connect()</span>, the 
first unit in the chain runs within the scope of the calling thread, the others 
run in separate threads.</p>
<p>The <span class="lang">unit</span> class is a subclass of <a href="unknown.html">component</a>, 
and thus it inherits reference counting and delete notification mechanisms from 
<span class="lang">component</span>. <span class="lang">Unit</span> is declared 
in <a href="include/pstreams.h.html">&lt;pstreams.h&gt;</a>.</p>
<p>This interface is available only in the multithreaded versions of the library. 
</p>
<p><span class="def">compref&lt;instm&gt; unit::uin</span> is a reference-counted 
pointer to an input stream, that is unit's input 'plug'. By default <span class="lang">uin</span> 
refers to the standard input object <span class="lang">pin</span>. Typically both 
<span class="lang">uin</span> and <span class="lang">uout</span> are assigned 
by the user of the unit after instantiating a unit object. You may assign dynamically 
allocated stream objects to <span class="lang">uin</span> and <span class="lang">uout</span> 
- they will be freed automatically by the 'smart' <span class="lang">compref</span> 
pointer.</p>
<p><span class="def">compref&lt;outstm&gt; unit::uout</span> -- same as <span class="lang">uin</span>; 
represents the output 'plug' of the unit.</p>
<p><span class="def">virtual void unit::main()</span> is unit's main code. Override 
this method to implement functionality of your mini-process. Note that code in 
<span class="lang">main()</span> must avoid accessing static/global data, since 
it may be executed in a separate thread. You may choose to write a reusable unit, 
i.e. when <span class="lang">main()</span> can be called multiple times for the 
same object, however <span class="lang">main()</span> is protected from overlapping 
(recursive) calls, which means, you need not to write reentrant code in this function.</p>
<p><span class="def">virtual void unit::cleanup()</span> -- override this method 
to perform finalization and cleanup of a unit. This function is guaranteed to 
be called even if <span class="lang">main()</span> threw an exception of type 
<span class="lang">(exception*)</span> or a derivative.</p>
<p><span class="def">void unit::connect(unit* next)</span> connects a unit object 
to another object using a local pipe. Multiple units can be connected to form 
a chain. A user then calls <span class="lang">run()</span> for the first object; 
all other members of the chain are being started automatically in separate threads.</p>
<p><span class="def">void unit::run(bool async = false)</span> runs a unit object. 
This function calls <span class="lang">main()</span> for the given object and 
possibly for other units, if this is the first object of a chain. You can not 
call <span class="lang">run()</span> for an object which is not the first in a 
chain. If <span class="lang">async</span> is <span class="lang">true</span>, this 
function starts a unit in a separate thread and returns immediately. Use <span class="lang">waitfor()</span> 
to synchronize with the completion of a unit if started asynchronously.</p>
<p><span class="def">void unit::waitfor()</span> waits for the unit to terminate 
if run asynchronously. For unit chains, this method needs to be called only for 
the first object in a chain.</p>
<p><b>Example</b>. Consider there is a unit type <span class="lang">ugrep</span> 
that performs regular expression matching and a unit type <span class="lang">utextconv</span> 
for converting various text formats. The code below demonstrates how to connect 
these units and run the chain.</p>
<blockquote> 
<pre>#include &lt;pstreams.h&gt;

#include &quot;ugrep.h&quot;        <span class="comment">// imaginary headers with unit declarations</span>
#include &quot;utextconv.h&quot;

USING_PTYPES

int main()
{
    ugrep grep;
    grep.regex = &quot;^abc&quot;;
    grep.casesens = false;

    utextconv textconv;
    textconv.from = CONV_UNIX;
    textconv.to = CONV_WIN;

    <span class="comment">// connect the two units and set up the input and output plugs.
</span>    grep.uin = new ipstream(&quot;somehost.com&quot;, 8282);
    grep.connect(&amp;textconv);
    textconv.uout = new outfile(&quot;output.txt&quot;);

    <span class="comment">// now run the chain; will read input from the socket, pass 
    // through the grep and textconv units and write it to the 
    // output file.</span>
    grep.run();
}
</pre>

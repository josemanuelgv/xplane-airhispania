<p class="hpath"><a href="index.html">Top</a>: PTypes demo program -- wshare</p>
<p><b><br>
Overview</b></p>
<blockquote> 
<p><span class="lang">Wshare</span> is a simple multithreaded web server (HTTP 
daemon) that uses almost all functional parts of the library and serves as an 
example of using PTypes. <span class="lang">Wshare</span> supports protocol versions 
up to HTTP/1.1. It provides simple means of sharing files over the web, but it 
lacks server-side scripting and authentication functionality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i> The program is covered by the same license as PTypes. The authors can not 
be responsible for any data loss or accidental disclosure of confidential information 
caused by this software. It is provided `as is' with the hope that it can be useful 
both as a library demo program and a simple web server.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sources are in <span class="lang">./wshare</span>. On UNIX, this application 
is being built along with the library and is being copied to <span class="lang">./bin</span>. 
For MSVC, a separate project is provided as a part of the PTypes workspace. For 
BCC on Windows, the makefile is <span class="lang">wshare/wshare.mak</span>.</p>
<p><span class="lang">Wshare</span> does not require any special installation 
or configuration procedures and can be easily run from the command line with at 
least one parameter: the directory you wish to share over the web. Note that <span class="lang">wshare</span> 
does not understand <span class="lang">.htaccess</span> or any other configuration 
files in your directories, so the web site you might previously have will run 
with <span class="lang">wshare</span>'s default configuration and access rights.</p>
<p><span class="lang">Wshare</span> is scalable: you can write your own handlers 
for new HTTP methods, virtual paths and for specific file extensions. Currently 
custom modules can be incorporated into <span class="lang">wshare</span> only 
at compile-time. Please, see <span class="lang">wshare/modules.h</span> and <span class="lang">wshare/request.h</span> 
for details. Also take a look at the sample compile-time module <span class="lang">wshare/mod_about.cxx.</span></p>
<p>Please, run the program to see the summary of the command-line options.</p>

</pre>

<p><b><br>
Running on UNIX</b></p>
<blockquote> 
<p>By default the daemon is trying to bind to port 80, which is a privileged port 
on UNIX. You will have to either run it as root, or to specify a port number higher 
than 1024 with the option <span class="lang">-p&nbsp;<i>port-number</i></span>, 
e.g. <span class="lang">-p 8080</span>.</p>
<p><span class="lang">Wshare</span> uses UNIX's syslog to log error messages. 
The HTTP access log goes to stderr, which can be overridden with <span class="lang">-o&nbsp;<i>logfile</i></span>.</p>
<p><span class="lang">Wshare</span> can also daemonize itself, i.e. detach from 
the console and remain active after the user logs out. Use option <span class="lang">-D</span> 
to daemonize the program. After that, the only way to stop the server is to send 
a SIGKILL signal, i.e. determine the process ID with <span class="lang">ps</span> 
and then invoke <span class="lang">kill&nbsp;-KILL&nbsp;<i>PID</i></span>. On 
some systems you will need to use <span class="lang">ps</span> with the option 
that specifies your user ID.</p>
<p>For better security, <span class="lang">wshare</span> can downgrade process 
privileges to the user/group specified through <span class="lang">-u <i>user</i></span> 
and <span class="lang">-g <i>group</i></span> command-line options. This is done 
after binding to the socket and opening the log file. If <span class="lang">-g</span> 
is omitted and only <span class="lang">-u</span> is specified, <span class="lang">wshare</span> 
downgrades the process to the primary group of that user. For example, if you 
specify <span class="lang">-u nobody</span>, the group will be automatically assigned 
to a group <span class="lang">nobody</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><br>
Running on Windows</b></p>
<blockquote> 
<p>On Windows <span class="lang">wshare</span> runs as a simple console application. 
All you can do with <span class="lang">wshare</span> on Windows is to specify 
a different port to bind to with option <span class="lang">-p&nbsp;<i>port-number</i></span> 
and to redirect the HTTP access log to some file with option <span class="lang">-o&nbsp;<i>logfile</i></span>. 
Redirecting the access log to a file instead of writing it to the console window 
can speed up the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><br>
Common features</b></p>
<blockquote> 
<p>By default <span class="lang">wshare</span> does not generate directory indexes 
(analogue of `Option Indexes' in Apache's configuration), which means the directory 
must have a default index file named as either of: <span class="lang">index.html</span>, 
<span class="lang">Index.html</span> or <span class="lang">default.htm</span>. 
Directory indexes can be allowed by specifying option <span class="lang">-d</span>. 
In this case, if the directory does not have any of the default index files listed 
above, <span class="lang">wshare</span> will generate a page with the list of 
files the directory contains.</p>
<p>If you don't want default index files at all, use option <span class="lang">-x</span> 
in the command line: the server will then show the directory indexes, like if 
you specified an empty &quot;DirectoryIndex&quot; directive with Apache.</p>
<p>You can limit the number of simultaneous connections with option <span class="lang">-n 
<i>num</i></span>, which is 30 by default. When the number of connections reaches 
<span class="lang">num/2</span> , the server stops supporting persistent connections. 
When it reaches <span class="lang">num</span>, the server sends &quot;503 Service 
unavailable&quot; to the client. And finally, when the number of connection requests 
reaches <span class="lang">num * 2</span>, wshare simply aborts the connection 
by closing the socket.</p>
<p>You can get the current status of the server by requesting <span class="lang">http://localhost/.wstat</span> 
in your browser. <span class="lang">Wshare</span> responds to this request only 
if the client is on the same host as the server, i.e. <span class="lang">localhost</span> 
or 127.0.0.1.</p>
<p>Some other features are hardcoded into <span class="lang">wshare</span> and 
can be changed only by recompiling it. The list of default index files can be 
found in <span class="lang">wshare/config.cxx</span>, and the file extension-to-MIME 
translation table is in <span class="lang">wshare/mimetable.cxx</span>. An awk 
script <span class="lang">wshare/mimetable.awk</span> is provided to translate 
an apache-style <span class="lang">mime.conf</span> file into C++ code that can 
be linked with <span class="lang">wshare</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><br>
Examples (UNIX)</b></p>
<blockquote> 
<p>The simplest usage:</p>
<blockquote> 
<p class="lang">wshare ./</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quickly share your files through port 8080 and ignore any index.html files 
in the directories:</p>
<blockquote> 
<p class="lang">wshare -x -p 8080 ~/mydocs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Run a real server for real users (must be root on UNIX):</p>
<blockquote> 
<p class="lang">wshare -D -n 100 -u nobody -o /var/log/wshare-access.log /usr/local/www</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BE CAREFUL and double check the directory you are opening to the world.</p>

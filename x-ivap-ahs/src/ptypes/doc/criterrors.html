<p class="hpath"><a href="index.html">Top</a>: Exceptions and critical errors</p>
<p>Some of the components in PTypes may produce unrecoverable error conditions, 
such like a list index is out of bounds, a stream object is constructed with inconsistent 
parameters, an operation on a stream is requested which requires buffering, etc. 
These errors are mainly caused by wrong usage of objects or functions of the library.</p>
<p>Whenever an unrecoverable error condition is raised, PTypes calls <span class="lang">fatal()</span> 
with a message describing the error condition and terminates the program. On most 
platforms this message is being sent to <span class="lang">stderr</span>, and 
on Windows the message is shown in a simple message box.</p>
<p>The function <span class="lang">fatal()</span> is declared in <a href="include/pport.h.html">&lt;pport.h&gt;</a>.</p>
<p>Some library components also raise recoverable error conditions (exceptions). 
PTypes only generates exception of type <span class="lang">(exception*)</span> 
defined in <a href="include/ptypes.h.html">&lt;ptypes.h&gt;</a>, or, in some cases, 
a derivative class, e.g. <span class="lang">(estream*)</span>. An exception object 
at least contains an error message which can be retrieved through <span class="lang">get_message()</span> 
method.</p>
<p> <b>NOTE</b>: Exception objects in PTypes are allocated dynamically and therefore, 
they should be freed by the catch block if it does not pass the exception farther. 
The exception class is derived from <a href="unknown.html">unknown</a> to help 
you to detect memory leaks in your program. If a thread in a multithreaded application 
is created using PTypes <span class="lang">thread</span> class, then all PTypes 
exceptions thrown in each thread are being caught and freed automatically (unless 
caught in the user code).</p>

X-IvAp is using Ben Supniks multiplayer code for XSquawkbox, and would have been impossible
to implement without his invaluable help. My personal thanks also go to Peter Meininger for
providing the CSL models for XSquawkbox and X-IvAp, to Sandy Barbour for the excellent
X-Plane SDK, Patrick Zangerle for the logo, Mikkel G. Hangaard and Splendor Bouman for
the first beta tests (and for hooking me to X-Plane), the people from the IVAO networking
and softdev departements as well as many many other nameless people who helped with the
creation of this plugin.
